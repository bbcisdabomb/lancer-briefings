# Mission // #008
## The Joy of Family

The long-haul freighter *Endurance*, carrying both cargo and Zamantha, has taken a shortcut to make it to the Dawnline Shore five years ahead of schedule. As the *Endurance* appeared distant to the Blinkgate, the freighter *The Joy of Creativity* disappeared for a full thirty seconds during a blink jump, appearing at the Dawnline Shore, well away from its intended destination. The two ships collided and are making a beeline toward the newly-appeared planet Gygax D 20.   

# Goals
- Save Gygax D 20 by destroying the space hulk.
- Try to figure out what caused this problem.
- Discover why this happened.

# Reserves
- Due to the extra speed from the repaired engine, you will have extra time to work with.
