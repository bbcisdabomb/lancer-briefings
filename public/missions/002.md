# Mission // #002
## Daybreak

The Sovereignty jamming is ubiquitous in the AO. Long-range communication is impossible. Rio has created a viral code-spike to take down the enemy comms and jamming network. Once the network is down, begin search and rescue efforts.

# Goals
- Neutralize enemy jamming network
- Maintain air superiority
- Locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee
- Cressedium security is a close <u>secondary</u> concern

# Stakes
- Failure to neutralize jamming will result in serious casualties
- Failure to secure the Captain and Ambassador will likely result in their capture and martyrdom
- Failure on either point with jeopardize Cressedium's willingness to join Union

# Reserves
- Exotic gear is available (ADUJTANT-Class Comp/Con, XC-BR Battle Rifle)
- Nearby sniper assets may be tapped
