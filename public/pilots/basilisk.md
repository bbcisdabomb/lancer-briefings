Zander Codex grew up following the Rogers formula, starting from loving your neighbor to slow dancing more. Known as a calm and placid young mechanic on the newly peaceful planet Cataclimax, Zander had a career, home, fiancee, and hopefully soon a child to fulfill his dream of an idyllic life.
Then his fiancee left him in the night, leaving only a note blaming him and his "lack of masculinity."
Zander couldn't find anything on Cataclimax to build his "masculinity" high enough, so he burned down his house and ranch, blew up his truck, and started a life of victimless crimes around his section of the galaxy. This helped, but it was only after convincing a stranger in a bar to go on a joyride with him (in what amounted to a space catamaran stolen from a scrapyard and mostly fixed) that Zander discovered the manliest thing he had ever heard of: Giant robot fights to the death!
After waking up from losing the fistfight with his bar buddy Daren (Daren was shouting something about being left behind but Zander was still quite drunk) Zander immediately (crash)landed by the nearest Union recruitment office to join the Navy. Joining the mechanized forces, Zander learned despite his deep mechanical understanding of his mech he lacked any sort of talent for piloting mech suits. The Union Navy, at the same time, learned that a complete lack of talent was not obstacle for a man unwilling to accept both defeat and failure.
Zander Codex spent four years going through basic and advanced training, progressing slowly from the bottom of his class to a solid middle of the road. Despite this, his deep understanding of his mech's systems meant he was generally the last one standing on his teams in practical exercises, even if it meant he was piloting a mech composed of half or less the amount of parts he started with.
