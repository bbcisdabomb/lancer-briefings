Carmel Crick has lead a charmed life. Her home planet of Hainope has long dropped in and out of space, appearing for a while before dropping into blinkspace for an inderminant time. Several hundred objective years ago Carmel took a trip off-planet and missed Hainope's blink. Carmel, never one to miss an opportunity, decided to use her stranding as an excuse to travel the galaxy.
Carmel accepted the life of a Cosmopolitain, travelling around the galaxy on long-haul journeys and taking whatever jobs were offered. Only a few objective decades after her stranding, the ever-stylish Carmel was approached by a Union envoy offering a modeling opportunity. Ever the shrewd negotiator, Carmel leveraged a small modelling job - along with her natural charisma and work ethic - into becoming the face of Union for a not-insigifant portion of the galaxy.
Despite a few subjective decades of work for Union in and out of mechs, Carmel has so far been insulated from actual combat. As part of Fireteam Blue, it would take some extreme circumstances to get her to the front lines now.
