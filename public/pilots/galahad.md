Born and raised on the wandering planet Gygax D 20, Darren Price nonetheless was always watching for the next source of excitement. All went well enough until a Cosmopolitan convinced him to go along for an interstellar joyride, during which his planet disappeared on a new wander and left Darren stranded.
After a fruitless search for his home planet, Darren wandered and eventually found his way to an underground mecha fighting ring. There he discovered and developed an impressive talent for mech fighting under the name The Overtaker. His rise to fame was meteoric and based on his record-setting win streak, but it all came crashing down after Darren refused to throw a match. He defeated his opponent, only to be shot by the owner of the fighting ring and left for dead.
Dead may have been Darren's fate, but for a passing surgeon discovering him. Kennedy Fairchild patched Darren up, then joined Darren in joining the Union Navy to escape the planet.
Now, under the callsign Galahad, Darren fights for peace, justice, and for the fate of the frankly impressive amount of people he's become friends with. Maybe someday he'll even forgive Zander for convincing him to go on a joyride, all those years ago.
