Harald Bogdanski seems to fall into the father archetype of whatever group he's assigned to. His home planet, Bradus IR 9-E, has rejected the eternal youth favored by most of the galaxy in favor of the concept of graceful age.

## TRIVIA

*Looks 45. Is 65. Good genes and a healthy skin care routine helps a lot.
