Kennedy Fairchild is, in many ways, the most normal person. To de-stress from her studies to become a surgeon she spent much too much time playing her planet's most popular game, a hyper-realistic mech fighting game name War of the Union States.
Kennedy had scarcely graduated with her medical license when she stumbled upon a man bleeding heavily in an alley. She was so distracted with patching Darren up she didn't even think twice about answering questions and ended up unwittingly signing up for the Union Navy alongside Darren.
Despite not planning on joining the Navy, Kennedy hasn't regretted the journey. There are people to save all over Union, and Kennedy is grateful to have the opportunity to save them.

*Had unquestionably the worst first day in her entire Union battalion. Holy shit.
