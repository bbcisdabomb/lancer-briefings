Kennedy Fairchild is, in many ways, the most normal person. Pushed into medical school by her mother, she kept in touch with her family in a hyper-realistic VR mech fighting game named Downfall of the Second Committee.
All was going well enough in her life and schooling until her father passed away about four weeks before her finals. She threw herself into passing everything, but on the night of her graduation she was drunkenly wandering around her college town when she stumbled upon a man bleeding heavily in an alley. She was so distracted with patching Darren up (while being extremely drunk) she didn't even think twice about answering questions and ended up unwittingly signing up for the Union Navy alongside Darren.
Despite not planning on joining the Navy, Kennedy hasn't regretted the journey. There are people to save all over Union, and Kennedy is grateful to have the opportunity to save them.

*Had unquestionably the worst first day in her entire Union battalion. Holy shit.
