Fireteam Blue receives their orders: Upload a virus to the enemy communications network, then begin search and rescue for the Captain and Ambassador. Successfully uploading the virus, Fireteam Blue receives an urgent call: Captain Faris has been located, and Fireteam Blue is the closest asset. They are dropped off at a submarine dock at the edge of town, where they disabled the submarine before taking its occupants prisoner and rescuing a wounded . As their dropship flies in, an anti-air missile chases it off and a coherent laser carves its way through the dock, killing most of the prisoners and critically wounding Ambassador Bannerjee. The mech who fired both climbs out of the water and and broadcasts to his allies in the open: "No survivors."  
After a long fight, Basilisk and Midas sacrifice their mechs to ram the main mech into the water, where its reactor goes critical. Fireteam Blue finishes off half the remaining forces and convinces the final mech to stop fighting for a chance to join the Union Navy, to which the pilot, callsign "Fucked", acquiesces.  
Flying quickly back to the Rio Grande, Fireteam Blue delivered both the captian and ambassador to medical services.
