Barely an hour later, as Gygax D 20 begins trade negotions with the Karrakin leadership, the *Endurance* appears from a vector oblique to where it is expected. Moments later, the blinkgate crackles to life and disgorges a barge freighter, identified as *The Joy of Creativity*, emerged, slamming into the *Endurance*. The *Endurance* almost immediately broadcast an Omega Sable signal, indicating the need for immediate destruction, though all attempts to do so have been foiled.
